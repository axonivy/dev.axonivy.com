			<header><h2>Security Vulnerability</h2></header>
			<p>
				<b>Affects version <i>6.0.0 up to and including 6.0.10</i> and <i>6.2.0 up to and including 6.7.1</i></b>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				We have identified a security vulnerability in our product that affects <b>versions 6.0.0 up to and including 6.0.10 and 6.2 up to and including 6.7.1</b>.
				The vulnerability affects only projects which make use of the User Task element introduced with 6.0. The vulnerability has been fixed with <a href="./">6.0.11 and 7.0</a>.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In specific constellations, the vulnerability allows to read process data which are intended for specific users/roles but without having the required permission.
				The vulnerability cannot be exploited by accident.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				We highly recommend updating productive systems as soon as possible if they make use of the User Task element.
				If you have any questions whether your system is affected by this vulnerability or not, please contact our support team by email: <a href="mailto:ivy@axonivy.com">ivy@axonivy.com</a>.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				We provide patches for any version between 6.0.x and 6.7.x so that intermediate versions (like 6.0.3, 6.2, 6.3 etc.) can be fixed quickly,
				without the need of an update to the latest major or minor version, see below the list of 'Available Patches'.
			</p> 
			
			<p>
				We apologize for the circumstances and hope to keep the damage as small as possible with our quick and proactive approach.
