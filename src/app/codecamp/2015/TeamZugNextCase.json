Plain task lists will always be interesting but if we take a look at successful apps or services on the web, then we can observe two patterns:<ul><li>They focus on one thing. Only one thing.</li><li>They support the user in decision making</li></ul>In future mobile devices, wearables and ubiquitous computing will play a major role in the developemnt (or transformation) of the economy. Maybe even newer ways of interacting with machines and humans will arise. In the code camp I like to think about new ways to interact with Ivy and implement some ideas in a prototype.",	"featureset": [		{			"title": "Generate ideas",			"description": "what could be the concepts, what are the opportunities we like to exploit"		},		{			"title": "Client side prototype",			"description": "Sketch the UI for the client.
