          A LTS release is the <b>most stable version</b>.

          During the maintenance period of an LTS release we provide <b>several update releases</b> which contains
          mainly bug fixes and tiny improvements.

          We always support the <b>two</b> latest LTS releases. 
        
          This <b>protects</b> a running, productive environment - an upgrade to a new update release comes with minimal risk.
          
          New LTS releases will always start with an <b>even</b> major version number.

      assistance for their specific, unsupported version. We offer an Extended Maintenance Support Contract to provide continued support in such cases.
