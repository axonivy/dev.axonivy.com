Roles and Users Responsible for Task and Process Starts:

- **Start Roles**: you can now configuree multiple roles on a start element, allowing any of them to start the corresponding process.
- **Task Responsibles**: Tasks can now be assigned to multiple roles and users simultaneously. There's no longer a need to create temporary dynamic roles just to assign a task to multiple entities.
- **Task Lists**: Both the Portal and Developer Workflow UI now display all responsible users and roles for each task in the task list.
- **Responsibles API**: New APIs are available to manage and query the multiple roles and users assigned to tasks.
- **Performance**: The Axon Ivy System Database schema has been optimized, and the implementations of TaskQuery and CaseQuery have been improvedâ€”resulting in significantly faster query response times.
