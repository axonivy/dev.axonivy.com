## NEO Designer {#neo}

The NEO Designer continues to advance as a streamlined, web-based low-code platform for rapid application development. In version 13.1, several functional enhancements were introduced to improve feedback, control, and accessibility.

- **CMS Editor**: A upgraded CMS Editor is now available in NEO, allowing users to create, edit, and delete multilingual content objects directly within the platform. It enables adding or removing languages and selecting which one are visible, simplifying CMS configuration across projects. Input validation, local based filtering, and a consistent editing experience simplify content management during development.
- **Keyboard Support**: Full keyboard navigation has been added across the entire NEO Designer. Users can now perform actions such as switching views, managing tiles, and editing forms or processes using shortcut keys improving speed and accessibility.
- **Internationalization**: The NEO Designer now supports multilingual interfaces with a built-in language switcher. English and German are currently available. All editor labels are externalized and ready for future translations.
- **Runtime Log View**: A new integrated log viewer allows users to inspect runtime logs by project, level, or log type (user/system). This simplifies debugging and improves visibility into process behavior without leaving the workspace.
- **Simulation Control Enhancements**: Process simulation behavior has been refined. Animation now waits for the editor to fully load before starting and avoids unnecessary transitions. Developers can also stop or reset the embedded engine directly from the interface, improving test iteration cycles.
- **Validation of User Input**: When creating new artifacts such as forms or processes, NEO now provides immediate feedback for invalid or conflicting names. This helps avoid misconfiguration and improves reliability during development.
- **Dialog Preview**: The improved Dialog Preview feature is now also available in NEO Designer. It allows for real-time previewing of forms and components, and enables quick navigation from visual elements back to source definition.
