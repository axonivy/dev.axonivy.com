## NEO Designer {#neo}

The NEO Designer continues to evolve as a modern, web-based low-code platform. In version 13.1, key improvements focus on feedback, accessibility, and content management.

- **Graph Views**: Visual diagrams of data class hierarchies and project dependencies help users understand and navigate large project structures.
- **Dialog Preview**: A reworked dialog preview allows live rendering of forms and components, with instant navigation to source definitions.
- **CMS Editor**: Enhanced support for multilingual content with the ability to add, remove, and manage languages. Improved validation, filtering, and editing make content configuration more efficient.
- **Keyboard Support**: Full shortcut navigation is now available across the UI, speeding up form editing, tile management, and process modeling.
- **Internationalization**: The interface is now available in English and German, with all labels externalized and ready for future translations.
- **Simulation Control Enhancements**: Process simulation behavior has been improved. The embedded engine can be reset or stopped without leaving the UI.
- **Runtime Log View**: A built-in log viewer helps developers filter and inspect runtime logs by level, source, or project directly within the workspace.
- **Validation on Creation**: Users now get immediate feedback when naming new forms or processes, preventing configuration errors early.
