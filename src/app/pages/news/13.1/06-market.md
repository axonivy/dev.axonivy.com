## Marketplace Website {#market}

- **Roles concept for marketplace community:** The roles of **OWNER** and **CODEOWNER** are primarily responsible for the maintenance and quality assurance of the open-source code. As a CONTRIBUTOR, anyone can contribute to the community - for further insights check out [this](https://github.com/axonivy-market/market/wiki).
- **German translations**:  With the new [Market website](https://github.com/axonivy-market/market/wiki), published with release 12.0,  German translations became necessary. We have provided them for the **Description** section of each connector.
- **Handling of deprecated market extensions**: Deprecated extensions were so far displayed in the Market in the same way as market extensions that are still being maintained. The + sign implies that versions beyond 11.3 will be maintained. This has been changed so the compatibility range is now displayed correctly.
- **Improve UX for search experience**: So far when you have clicked on the magnifyer glass on top right of the market website you have been forwarded to the developer space. This has been changed so you stay on the market website when searching. The search space is:
  - https://market.axonivy.com/
  - https://www.axonivy.com/ 
  - https://developer.axonivy.com/
- **Approval step for feedback comments**: A new approval process is being introduced for feedback management of the connectors.
