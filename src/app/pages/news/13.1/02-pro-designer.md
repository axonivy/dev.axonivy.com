## PRO Designer {#proDesigner}

The PRO Designer continues to evolve as the primary environment for professional developers, with version 13.1 introducing enhancements for the development of more robust and maintainable applications.

- **Dialog Preview**: Reintroduced with a more stable implementation, the preview enables live rendering of forms and XHTML dialogs with direct navigation to element definitions.

- **Form Editor Enhancements**: Editable Data Tables, reusable form components (including fieldsets and panels), and visual improvements like better alignment, drag-and-drop, and new button styles enhance design flexibility. Attribute validation and keyboard support improve accuracy and speed.

- **Process Editor**: Now powered by GLSP v2.3.0, the editor delivers smoother interaction and rendering. Expanded keyboard shortcuts streamline navigation and editing.

- **Inscription View**: IvyScript hints, a better Function Browser, and an embedded Condition Builder improve scripting and configuration. Improved stability, especially during tab switching and editor focus.

- **Data Class Editor**: Improved annotation validation and relationship configuration. Field badges and keyboard accessibility increase clarity and efficiency.

- **Variable Editor**: Now faster and easier to use with large sets of variables. Inline validation and full keyboard control are supported.

All new features introduced in the PRO Designer are also available in the NEO Designer.
