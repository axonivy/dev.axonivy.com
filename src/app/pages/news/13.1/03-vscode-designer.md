## Visual Studio Code PRO Designer Extension (Preview) {#vsCodeDesigner}

The Visual Studio Code PRO Designer Extension continues to expand as the future platform for Ivy application development offering a modern, extensible, and developer-friendly alternative to the Eclipse-based PRO Designer. With version 13.1, the extension introduces key additions while continuing to support essential modeling features such as the Process Editor, Form Editor, and Variable Editor.

**New in 13.1:**

- **Data Class Editor**: Manage field structures, annotations, and relationships in a visual interface
- **CMS Editor**: Create and edit multilingual content (cms.yaml) with built-in validation
- **Runtime Log View**: Inspect engine logs by level, source, and project directly in the IDE
- **Improved Java Support**: Java-based Ivy projects can now be developed and built using standard Maven tooling, without relying on Eclipse-specific configurations

The extension remains in preview, and your feedback plays a central role in shaping its evolution. The goal is a modern, focused, and flexible IDE that preserves the strengths of the Eclipse-based PRO Designer while aligning with todayâ€™s development expectations.
