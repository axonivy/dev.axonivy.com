## Variables Editor (Alpha) ðŸ§ª {#variablesEditor}

The first of many next-generation config editors has arrived!

- **Low-Code**: Instead of having to navigate a YAML document that can get pretty big, you can now edit your variables with a handy user interface.
- **Features**: Add or delete variables, and find what you are looking for by using the integrated search functionality. After selecting a variable, you can see all its information in the detail view. Change its name, value, description, and metadata while the UI adapts to your choices.
- **Alpha**: More features and improvements to the user experience are coming.
