## Business Notification API {#notificationAPI}

Just introduced in 11.2, we now extended the Notifications feature even more.

* Keep the users of a process up to date by using the new business notification API and event.
* Notification messages have been streamlined, improved, and look better than ever.
* All the information needed to fulfill your daily work is only a click away with the new link in notification messages to the details pages of the corresponding case or task. 
* Customize the task notification message to the needs of your process by configuring the used notification template for a task.
