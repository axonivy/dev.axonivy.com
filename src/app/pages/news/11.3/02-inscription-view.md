## Inscription View {#inscriptionView}

The new Inscription View is finally feature complete! You are able to configure 
all elements on the totally redesigned interface.

- **UI update**:  Prepare to be amazed by the refreshed user interface! 
Thanks to the sleek new design, navigating through inscriptions has 
never been smoother, making oversight effortless. The UI update not only 
attends to the needs of advanced users but also makes the functionality 
more appealing for new users. Among other things, the redesign features 
collapsible sections for every subpart, improved tab naming, and overall interface streamlining.
- **Browsers**: We added assisting browsers to search for CMS entries, DataClass attributes, 
Java-Types and the like. These browsers make element configurations an easy and swift 
user experience without the need to write any code.
- **Code Completion**: A notable improvement in this version is the completion 
list within script/code fields. You now get more functions, types, and attributes 
auto-inserted whenever you ask for it.
