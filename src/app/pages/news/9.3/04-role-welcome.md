## Role based Welcome {#role93}

The Designer welcome page assists you in settings up the workspace according to your role.

- **Accessible**: simple and uncluttered featureset to onboard new users quickly into the first Process drawing experience.
- **Advanced actions**: Testers and Developers don't loose any features, but gain quick access to advanced features.
- **Project filters**: contents within the Project tree will be filtered according to your role. Either to reduce complexity or to expose advanced configs. You can switch at any time to a different filterset.
