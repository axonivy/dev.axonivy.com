## Updated Market {#marketConnectors93}

The Axon.ivy Market is gaining momentum, becoming a powerful ecosystem for all digital transformation projects.

- __Growing__ : more connectors are ready to be taken from the shelf. To name a few, the community partnered 
with us to supply new connectors for SFTP, the Swiss Phone Directory and Amazon's Natural Language Processing services.
- __Templates__ : our template repository empowers you to develop your own product in no time. In fact, everything
is pre-configured to make your contribution as simple as possible.
- __Compatible__ : pre-defined build pipelines, and secure versioned maven repositories are waiting to serve
your product. Therefore, maintaining a widely used Market product over time, while the Designer featureset evolves,
becomes a simple and convenient task.
