## Config files {#project93}

The entire configuration in Axon Ivy projects has been revised and consolidated.
This will make the daily life for all developers much easier.

- __Streamlining__ : The configuration of rest clients, web service clients, databases or variables now looks exactly the same in your Axon Ivy project as on the Axon Ivy Engine.
- __Known file extensions__ : All configuration files now have standard file extensions which gives you code hihghlighting in all other tools and also when sending a pull request to a friend.
- __Project Tree__ : All configuration files in the Axon Ivy project are located under the ``Config`` folder both in Axon Ivy Designer and physically on the file system - full transparency.
