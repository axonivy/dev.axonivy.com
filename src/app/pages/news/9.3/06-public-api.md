## Public API {#publicApi93}

With twenty years of project experience, we knew what customers expect from a powerful process automation platform.
The newly added API makes your life even easier. 

- **<a href="${docBaseUrl}/public-api/ch/ivyteam/ivy/security/ISecurity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ISecurity</a>**: 
  `ivy.security` and `Ivy.security()` provide a lot of methods to manage users, roles, security members and sessions.
- **<a href="${docBaseUrl}/public-api/ch/ivyteam/ivy/security/IRoleMatcher.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IRoleMatcher</a>**:
  Makes it easy to check if the current session user has a certain role.

  In addition, new API methods take a role name instead of a role instance.
