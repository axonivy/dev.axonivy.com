## NEO Designer {#neo}

We are excited to introduce the new NEO Designer, a streamlined, web-based low-code platform for rapid application development. It provides essential features to simplify task automation, reduce complexity, and deploy scalable applications efficiently.

- **Enhanced Form and Process Editors**: Upgraded Form Editor for intuitive design and a Process Editor with real-time animation for workflow visualization, along with an integrated browser for reviewing and simulating applications before deployment.
- **Data Class and Variable Editors**: Includes a Data Class Editor for visualizing data and a Variable Editor that supports the import of variables across projects, streamlining complex management.
- **Deployment and Market Integration**: Deploy projects directly to the Axon Ivy engine and access the Axon Ivy Market to browse and install connectors and demo workflows within the platform.

With enhanced usability, seamless workspace management and robust integration capabilities, NEO Designer enables business users to build and maintain scalable applications with ease.
