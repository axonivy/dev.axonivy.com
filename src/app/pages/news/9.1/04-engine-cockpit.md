## Engine Cockpit 2.0

We have worked hard to make the Engine Cockpit even better! And because we want
everyone to benefit from these new features, we have ported some of them (like the
**LDAP Browser** and the **PMV Dependency view**) back to LTS. And we made many small
improvements that hopefully make your life easier. Let's have a look at them:

- __LDAP Browser__: Easy browsing of your connected security directory.
- __PMV Dependency View__: Overview over your dependencies between PMVs, with feedback if something is missing.
- __MBean Monitor__: More ways to monitor your running system without installing the VisualVM tool.
- __Restart Hint__: Prominent warning if a change in your configuration requires an engine restart.
