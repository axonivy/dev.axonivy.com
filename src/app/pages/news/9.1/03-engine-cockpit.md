## Engine Cockpit

We have worked hard to make the Engine Cockpit even better! And because we want
you to benefit from those new features, we have ported some of them (like the
**LDAP Browser** and the **PMV Dependency view**) back to LTS. Besides the
bigger features there are many small improvements that hopefully makes you life
easier. But let's have a look at them:

- __LDAP Browser__: Easy browsing of your connected security directory.
- __PMV Dependency View__: Overview of your dependencies between the single PMVs with feedback if something is missing.
- __MBean Monitor__: More ways to monitor your running system without install the VisualVM tool.
- __Restart Hint__: Prominent warning if you change a configuration that requires an engine restart.
