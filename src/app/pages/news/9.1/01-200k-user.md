## Efficient user scaling {#user-scaling}

We have made great efforts to ensure that our engine can serve hundreds of
thousands of users quickly and efficiently. This is achieved through many
memory, performance, UI and API improvements. In addition, users can be enabled
or disabled.

- __Disabled users__: Users are now disabled instead of deleted. As a result, the
  task state UNASSIGNED is no longer relevant.
- __User synchronization__: The user synchronization is much faster and has an improved logging.
- __New user query__: There is a new API to easily search users.
- __UI improvements__: The Engine Cockpit can handle huge numbers of users and roles.
- __Task-/Case query__: Faster database queries thanks to a simplified database schema.
