## Config File Editor {#configEditor}

Reviewing and editing engine configuration files is simple and powerful with the new built-in Config File Editor.

While editing our prominent YAML files, you have a rich set of authoring features at hand:

- **Validation**: keys used within the YAML files are validated against the official schema. So invalid values are being blamed with a warning marker.
- **Completion**: by pressing `CTRL+Space` the context completor helps you to identify and select valid configuration values or keys.
- **Help**: by hovering over keys you get context-specific documentation right where you are editing.
- **Formatting**: YAML content has strict formatting rules, and the editor takes care that whitespace indents are correct and in effect.
