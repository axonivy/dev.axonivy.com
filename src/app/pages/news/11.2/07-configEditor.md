## Config File Editor {#configEditor}

Reviewing and editing engine configuration files is simple and powerful with the new built-in Config File Editor.

While editing our prominent YAML files, you have a rich set of authoring features at hand:

- **Validation**: Keys used within the YAML files are validated against the official schema. So, invalid values are being blamed with a warning marker.
- **Completion**: By pressing `CTRL` + `Space`, the context completion helps you identify and select valid configuration values or keys.
- **Help**: Hovering over keys lets you get context-specific documentation right where you are editing.
- **Formatting**: YAML content has strict formatting rules, and the editor ensures whitespace indents are correct and in effect.
