## Engine Cockpit {#engineCockpit}

We added fantastic world-class monitoring, user management, operations, and configuration features to the Engine Cockpit.

- **Configuration**: The new **System/SSL** view to manage your certificates. The new **System/Config File Editor** helps you view and edit any configuration file.
- **User Management**: The user details view shows a user's substitutes and absences. 
  The security identity provider configuration view has been re-implemented and now features a directory  browser for Microsoft Entra ID (formally known as Azure AD).
- **Operations**: Restart the Axon Ivy Engine with the Engine Cockpit. Merge security contexts and move applications to help you migrate your Axon Ivy Engine from LTS 8
- **Monitoring**: Use the new **Class Histogram**, **Threads**, **Flight Recorder** view to analyze memory leaks, performance bottlenecks, or endless loops. Also, the **Notification**, **Documents**, **Start Events**, and **Intermediate Events** view were added.

The Engine Cockpit is now also available in the Axon Ivy Designer. The Preferences for **SSL Client** and **Email** were removed. Use the Engine Cockpit to configure these settings.
