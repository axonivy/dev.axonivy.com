## Notification {#notification}

User notifications have been completely redesigned to provide a holistic user experience. 
Not only end-users get a transparent notification journey, but also system administrators
benefit from a simplified management experience.

- **Channels**: With the Web, Mail, and Microsoft Teams channels, Axon Ivy Engine comes with three built-in channels.
- **Templating**: The content of the user notifications can be changed via a standardized templating mechanism.
- **Subscription**: Administrators can set the default subscriptions, and the users themselves can override these settings in their profiles.
- **Monitoring**: Notifications will be traced and can be monitored in the Axon Ivy Engine Cockpit.
