## S3 Document Store {#s3}

Workflow documents can now be saved in S3-compatible storage. S3 has many advantages over the conventional local file system:

- **Platform-independent**: You don't have to deal with the local file system.
- **Cluster-ready**: It works in a cluster, and you no longer have to share a directory
between cluster nodes.
- **S3 Features**: S3 providers come with a lot of features, like retention policies, encryption, versioning, backup, and many more.
- **Pluggable**: Not happy with S3? With the new pluggable architecture, you can even implement your own document storage.

Additionally, you can inspect all the workflow documents in the Axon Ivy Engine Cockpit.
