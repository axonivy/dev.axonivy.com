## Inscription View (Beta) {#inscriptionView}

One step further on our path to finalize our new web-based Inscription Views!
We replaced default inscriptions from the old SWT-based software and experience to the future of inscription editing.
Beside of new features, we integrated it fully inside of the process editor and give it a big UI / UX update.

- __Process Editor integration__: The new inscription view is fully integrated into the existing process editor, to provide you the best user experience.
  Implemented as a sidebar, a double click upon an element opens it and sub-sequent selections will update the view.
- __Faster__: The new UI lazy loads all data and additionally information to improve the loading speed.
- __Undo__: If you make changes and want to revert them,  you can now undo a complete section with one click.
- __Validations__: Validation messages are now directly located to the configuration input, to give you a better hint what and where is something wrong.
- __UI update__: We spend a big UI update to the inscription view to improve the overview of your configurations.
