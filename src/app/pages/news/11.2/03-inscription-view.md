## Inscription View (Beta) {#inscriptionView}

We are one step further on our path to finalizing our new web-based Inscription Views!
We replaced default inscriptions from the old SWT-based software and experienced the future of inscription editing.
Besides new features, we integrated it fully inside the process editor and gave it a big UI / UX update.

- __Process Editor integration__: The new inscription view is fully integrated into the existing process editor to provide the best user experience.
  Implemented as a sidebar, a double click upon an element opens it, and subsequent selections will update the view.
- __Faster__: The new UI lazy loads all data and additional information to improve the loading speed.
- __Undo__: If you make changes and want to revert them, you can undo a complete section with one click.
- __Validations__: Validation messages are now directly located to the configuration input to give you a better hint of what and where something is wrong.
- __UI update__: We spent a big UI update to the inscription view to improve the overview of your configurations.
