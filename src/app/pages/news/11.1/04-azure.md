## Azure AD User Properties {#azure}

We're excited to announce that our Azure AD support has just improved! 
With our latest update, you can easily synchronize user properties from Azure Active Directory 
with Axon Ivy user properties. 
You can seamlessly integrate essential details like phone numbers and department information 
into your workflows for a more streamlined user experience.
