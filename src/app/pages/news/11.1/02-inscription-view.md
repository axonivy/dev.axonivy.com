## Inscription View (Preview) {#inscriptionView}

We started to replace the SWT-based Inscription Editors with a new, fully
web-based alternative. This is only the first step, and it does not support all
configuration of all elements. And as it is only a preview, everything can
change in the future.

- __Browser compatible__: The new inscription view runs on native web
  technologies.
- __View__: As it is implemented as View, no Dialog opens and the content
  changes after you select another element.
- __Immediate feedback__: With new technology we want also to improve the user
  experience with a faster feedback.
- __IvyScript editor__: We use the monaco editor for IvyScript inputs with
  autocompletion and better writing experience.
