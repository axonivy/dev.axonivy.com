## Marketplace {#market}

**Marketplace Website**

- **Improved UI for monitoring:** In our effort to provide greater transparency on the status of our Market extensions, we have improved the monitoring UI
- **Simplify publishing to the market**:  As our community of publishing connectors grows, we received feedback that some steps in the publishing process are quite complex. We simplified this by adding a GitHub workflow to our publish-template – now everything can be done with just a few clicks. We also add a nice drag & drop feature for previewing your artefact.
- **Beautifying the market extension changelog**:Thanks to your feedback, the Market Extension changelog is now clearer and makes it easier to follow what’s new in each version.

**New Market Extensions**

- **Case Process Viewer**: We have implemented a UI component to be integrated in an Axon Ivy UI for visualizing the current step in a process.
- **Chapta Utils**: CHAPTCHA is a "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart" - it’s a security mechanism used on websites to distinguish between real human users and automated bots.
- **Axon Ivy Cells**: For document handling (.doc, .xlsx, .pdf, images), we have DocFactory in the Axon Ivy marketplace. We now have Axon Ivy Cells. Coming soon: Text processing, Pdf, image generation.
- **Prozess Analyser**: The Market extension "Process Analyzer" is a tool for visualizing process usage.
- **Case Mail Component**: The new Email Connector is designed to send and receive emails related to a specific Ivy case. All sent emails are automatically linked to their corresponding case, providing seamless tracking and management of communication within the workflow.
- **Azure Service Bus**: This connector enables integration with Azure Service Bus, allowing you to configure multiple connections for sending and receiving messages via queues and topics.
- **IBM Db2 LUW**: This connectors provides a JDBC driver for IBM's DB2 (Linux, Unix, Windows) database.
