## Agentic Orchestration & AI Process Generation {#ai}

With version 13.2, we extend the existing AI portfolio (IDP, Portal Assistant, LLM connectors) with two new components that integrate deeply into the Axon Ivy Platform:

- **Smart Workflow**: Smart Workflow introduces a mechanism to integrate agents directly into Axon Ivy. It combines deterministic process steps with adaptive, AI-driven decision logic. The goal is to enable flexible orchestration where predefined process flows can interact with agent-based intelligence.

- **Smart Core**: Smart Core adds a native MCP server to the Axon Ivy Engine. This enables the generation of Ivy artifacts, such as processes, data classes, forms, or connectors directly from natural language.
