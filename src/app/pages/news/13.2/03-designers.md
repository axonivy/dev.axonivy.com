## Designers {#designers}

Axon Ivy 13.2 delivers major improvements to the overall design experience across both of our design environments:

- **NEO Designer**: the web-based, intuitive tool for business technologists
- **PRO Designer (VS Code Extension)**: the professional development environment for experienced developers

All new features listed below are available in **both** NEO and the VS Code PRO Designer, ensuring a unified and consistent design experience for every role.

- **CMS Editor Enhancements**: A smoother multilingual editing workflow, now with integrated translation capabilities.

- **Form Editor Enhancements**: Support for lazy data models, listener properties, component conversion with preserved properties, and unified dialog framework enables richer, more responsive UI development. Column widths can also be controlled and previewed directly in the editor.

- **New XHTML Editor**: Smart code completion, validation, and contextual hover information make XHTML for HTML Dialog editing faster and more reliable.

- **Generate from Data**: Entity Form generation from databases accelerates the generation of UIs for master data editing and ensures visual consistency without manual boilerplate.

- **Improved Configuration & Inscription Experience**: A unified improvement that streamlines configuration tasks, organizes related settings into tabs, and provides better defaults and more intuitive configuration elements.

- **Process Modeling Refinements**: Enhanced copy/paste (including text and images), more intuitive insert actions, and improved undo/redo make modeling smoother and more efficient.

- **BPMN-2 Import Improvements**: Importing BPMN-2 diagrams has been improved, making migration from BPMN modeling tools more reliable and preserving semantic fidelity. Standard BPMN icons can now also be applied directly in the model.

- **NEO Designer Updates**: NEO receives usability refinements and an integrated Runtime Log View for quicker diagnostics while designing and testing processes.
