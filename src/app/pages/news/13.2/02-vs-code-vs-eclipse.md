## Visual Studio Code Extension vs. Eclipse-based PRO Designer {#vscode}

The **Visual Studio Code Extension** is now the primary PRO Designer, offering a modern and actively evolving environment despite its **beta** status. The **Eclipse-based PRO Designer** is in maintenance mode with only essential bug fixes and no new features in 13.2.

New Features in the VS Code Extension:

- **Project Conversion**: Easily migrate existing projects into the VS Code–based PRO Designer.

- **IAR Support**: Full handling of Ivy Archive (*.iar) files, including import and dependency management.

- **Integrated Test Execution**: Run Ivy tests directly in VS Code with faster execution and tighter integration.

- **Engine Download & Maven Build**: Automatic Engine management and simplified Maven builds using the standard compiler plugin.
