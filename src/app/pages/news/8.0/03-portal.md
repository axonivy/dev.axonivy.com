## Portal

We re-styled the Portal  application completely and implemented a lot of new features.
 
 * __Group Chat__: Establish chats with other workflow users instantly, even case related
 * __Announcements__: Promote planned maintenance and other global announcements conveniently, in multiple languages
 * __Express data providers__: Add your custom data source to provide data for Axon.ivy Express form widgets
