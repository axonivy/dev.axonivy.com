## Debian Engine Installer

The Axon.ivy Engine is now available as a Debian package. Now Engine operators can benefit from the rich tooling on the preferred platform of most cloud providers.

 * __SIMPLE__: Install & run the Engine with one click.
 * __BEST PRACTICE__: Run the Axon.ivy Engine as systemd service and restricts the access to Engine and workflow application files.
 * __UPDATEABLE__: Install the latest hotfix version without risky manual steps.
 * __SECURE__: Keep your manual changes in configuration files during updates.
 * __FRIENDLY__: Organize files compliant with the Linux file structure and re-use the JVM provided by the system.
