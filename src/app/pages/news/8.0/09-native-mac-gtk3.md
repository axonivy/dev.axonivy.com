## Native MAC & GTK3 Development

Run the Axon.ivy Designer with the operating system you know and love most. 

 * __MAC Designer__: We released the first native Axon.ivy Designer for Mac OS X. Now you can digitalize your business on a Mac without starting a virtualized OS.
 * __Linux GTK3__: The latest designer has been optimized to work with the most popular desktop environments on Linux. As a result, we were able to update the embedded browser, delivering way more accurate results when modern CSS & JavaScript is used.
 * __Process Editor__: Many new native UI components are now available for all platforms: Context Menu, Inscription Masks
 * __Html Dialog Editor__: It dropped its strict coupling to the JavaFX-based WYSIWYG editor and therefore runs on all platforms.
