## Customizable Designer {#customizable-designer}
We made the latest Axon.ivy Designer much more flexible, so that it serves best for your development needs.

* __Lighter__: 
    * The Xpert.ivy 3.9 import feature has been retired. 
    * The project reporting feature is no longer included. But you can install it via the pre-configured update site.
* __Up to date__: 
     * Many developers switched to GIT as their primary source control management system. Now we ship the _EGit_ team provider together with a new version of _Subclipse_ for SVN users.
     * Independent features of the designer such as GIT or SVN can now be updated. Now you are not bound to the Axon.ivy Designer release cycle to get the latest third-party improvements anymore.
* __Totally yours__: 
     * You do not require some core parts of the Designer at all? We isolated features of the Designer so that you can uninstall them. 
     * Why don't you craft your custom Axon.ivy Designer with the essentials for you and your team?
