		<h5>OpenAPI power</h5>
		<p>We believe that the <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI initiative</a> made communications over system boundaries
		efficient, well documented and a pleasure to do. So, we gladly comply with it by documenting
		REST services by default in OpenAPI format. Nevertheless, we made the consumption of OpenAPI
		documented services joyful and easy so that you can instantly involve powerful 
		OpenAPI services with zero technical burden.
		</p>

		<h5>Market</h5>
		<p>Big and small brands are all gathered in our refreshed Market. We offer connectors 
		to frequently used services such as Microsoft Office, DocuSign, Twitter and more. 
		Our products are free of charge gifts to empower your solutions. Even so, it's not a closed
		eco-system. Far from it, we are eager to see new powerful installable components from you.
