## Axon Ivy Portal {#portal92}

The Portal-Team has been working hard to give you a better user experience,
supporting:

- __Forgot password__: Simply reset your password using the new built-in feature
  on the login screen.
- __Simplified tasks and cases export__: Exporting tasks and cases is now even
  more powerful and easier.
- __Redesigned process list__: The new grid layout gives you a new refreshed
  overview of your available processes.
- __Configurable detail pages__: The task and case detail pages can now be
  customized to your needs without a single line of code.
- __Advanced user specific settings__: There are now even more options to
  configure the Portal to your wishes and preferences. So take a look at the new
  settings in the *My Profile* section.
