## OpenAPI backend {#openAPIbackend}

We believe that the [OpenAPI initiative](https://www.openapis.org) made communications over system boundaries
efficient, well documented and a pleasure to do. So, we gladly comply with it by documenting
REST services by default in OpenAPI format.

- __Auto documented__: You define services in Java as you always did. All your services are automatically described in OpenAPI compatible format under http://localhost:8081/api/designer/openapi.json.
- __Industry standard__: OpenAPI service descriptions have become the de-facto standard to describe REST interfaces. Consequently, third parties should gladly accept your service descriptions in OpenAPI format.
- __Prototyping UI__: Axon Ivy products have a built in API browser so that you can easily examine your service descriptions and send data to the service, without reading technical descriptor files.
- __Extended docs__: By adding OpenAPI service annotations you can fine-tune the service presentation apart from technical  data flow descriptions. Your service users will be glad to find prose and examples to clarify vaild use-cases of your services.
- __Core services__: Not only services from your workflow application, but Axon Ivy core services too are now documented in OpenAPI manor. Therefore, the documentation of the deployment and mobile-workflow endpoints has been improved.
