## Migration Wizard {#migrationWizard}

Keeping Axon Ivy Engines up-to-date, stable and protected against security vulnerabilities has never been easier. The new Migration Wizard sets up a new Engine in seconds by re-using the configurations and data from a previously installed Engine. 

- __Hotfix Update__ : Painful updates to the latest Engine are a thing of the past. Just download and unpack a new Engine, boot it, run the migration wizard and your done.
- __Guided Update__ : We just do what is best in your existing configuration and automatically apply internal format changes to your configuration files.
- __Users Choice__ : In some migration scenarios the best configuration updates depend on your running application. For crucial changes, we ask your consent or choice to proceed. In addition, a nice config diff viewer helps you to decide wisely.
- __Lean Docs__ : The Migration Notes document now contains tagss to define the target audience of a change. Therefore, the relevant migration tasks for you can be much easier identified, and you may skip the other parts at large.
- __Major Update__ : Migrating from one major version (e.g. 8.0.4 LTS) to a newer (e.g. 9.2.0 LE) is supported, too. All necessary configuration changes are enforced and selected, based upon the version you are migrating from/to.
