Customize and categorize your process list to match your company's individual

- __Process Starts Icon and Category__ : Define an icon for each process start and categorize them, customizing the look-and-feel of the process list.
- __Process Element Decorator Icons__ : Improve your process designs by defining icons for REST Client, Web Service and Database configurations.
  These icons will then be used in all process elements and selection windows.
- __Call Sub Decorator Icons__ : Enhance your Callable Sub Processes with custom icons.
  These will be used in the Call Sub process elements when choosing the sub process and as decorator icon.
- __Call Sub Documentation__ : Make your Callable Sub Processes easier to use for other developers by adding tags, descriptions and descriptions for parameters.
  These tags and descriptions will show up in the Call Sub process element when choosing starts and defining input-output mappings, even in the attribute browser.
