## CMS {#cms}

We have renovated the content management system (CMS for short) completely. We changed th internal concept radically resulting in a smart CMS with many new features.

- __Small and Smart__: Fewer files lead to better performance in day-to-day development as well as at runtime in the Axon Ivy Engine.
- __Standard__: The CMS now does not consist of a properitary format. Files and folders reflect 1:1 the structure of the CMS.
- __cms.yaml__: All texts are now in one file the cms.yaml. Single-line texts as well as multi-line texts are no longer distinguished.
- __Any files__: We now support all file types.
- __Change at runtime__: With the Application CMS, the CMS can now be customized at runtime.
