User experience is a top priority in process automation projects. 
That is why the Axon Ivy Portal has been massively enhanced.

- __Customizable Dashboard__: End-users can choose between different layouts, enable and disable default columns and even add custom columns at will.
- __Default Widgets__: Axon Ivy Portal supports a sophisticated concept featuring default widgets for Process Starts, Task Lists, and Case Lists.
- __Custom Widgets__: Individuality is king. End-users can easily create custom widgets in the dashboard.
- __Adjustable Look for Process List__: Switch between an image, grid, and compact mode to display available processes.
