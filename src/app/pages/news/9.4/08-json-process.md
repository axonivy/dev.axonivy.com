## New Process File Format {#jsonProcess}

The storage format of Ivy processes has been rewritten to JSON. 

- __GIT friendly__: changes in a process can be easily reviewed and tracked without using the Designer tooling.
- __Expressive__: the new JSON format uses natural hierarchies and omits default values in order to be an effective communicator of the process configuration applied. 
- __Quick__: the JSON Inscription view assists you in quickly reviewing the currently selected process elements without opening the full blown inscription editor.
