## UI Revisions {#ui-revision}

We refurbished our general look and feel with a new PrimeFaces version, a new
default Theme and a complete new way to brand an Axon Ivy Engine according to
your company.

- __PrimeFaces 11__: We updated from PrimeFaces 7 to 11, which means a lot of
  new and updated widgets. Be aware of our separate [PrimeFaces
  Migration-Guide](${docBaseUrl}/axonivy/migration/migration-notes-94.html#primefaces-11).
- __Freya Theme__: We also provide the [Freya
  Theme](https://www.primefaces.org/layouts/freya) as new default theme for your
  HTML Dialogs. The refreshed look of it also supports dark mode and of course
  we updated the `Dev-Workflow-UI` and the `Engine Cockpit` also to this new
  theme.
- __Branding__: There is a complete new way to
  [brand](${docBaseUrl}/designer-guide/user-interface/branding/index.html) an Axon
  Ivy Engine according to your company colors and logo, without the need to
  change the `Axon Ivy Portal` or something else.
