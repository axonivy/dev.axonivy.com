## Azure Active Directory {#azure}

With Azure Active Directory, Axon Ivy is now able to support its first cloud-based Identity Provider. This means that your employees can simply use the well-known Microsoft login in order to access the Axon Ivy Platform.

- __Simple user management__: Maintain your users in one place, namely Azure Active Directory. Easily synchronize these users with Axon Ivy and make your business processes instantly accessible to the entire organization.

- __User credentials__: Employees do not have to worry about additional user credentials. Access is simple and secure via the Microsoft login.

- __OAuth 2.0__: With Microsoft login, the industry-standard OAuth 2.0 protocol is used for authorization. Consequently, Axon Ivy is no longer aware of these users' passwords and secure delegated access is granted.
