## Slow Requests and Traffic Graph {#tracing}

It is key for an orchestration platform like Axon Ivy to provide tools to analyze problems. 
The new Slow Requests and Traffic Graph views in the Engine Cockpit provide you with all 
the information you need to find the sources of trouble in your orchestrated solution.

- __Slow Requests__: Have a look at the slowest requests. Dive into a request and 
  see which systems are called by it.
- __Traffic Graph__: Gives you an overview of all incoming and outgoing traffic. 
  You see in one graph which system returns errors or is slow in answering requests.
