## Primefaces 11 {#primefaces}

The brand-new Developer Workflow UI will make it easier for developers to create and work with workflows and processes. 
It is made with JSF and is a replacement for the old JSP Designer Workflow UI.

- __Accessible Info__: The modern design makes it easier to find any information about tasks, cases and more.
- __Last Starts__: Last started Processes and Case Maps will be shown in a list on the Homepage where you can easily start them again.
- __Iframe Support__: Processes and tasks start in an iframe.
