## New Process Editor {#processEditor}

We worked hard to replace the old (AWT based) Process Editor with a new one (Web
compatible). This gives us the power to implement new features and improvements
faster.

- __Browser compatible__: The new Process Editor runs on native Web
  technologies.
- __Element Palette__: The Element Palette is now split into the different
  categories, to make it easier for you to find the wanted element.
- __Quick Actions__: Besides the new look and feel of the editor view, there is a new
  way to interact with process elements. The Quick-Action-Bar gives you a range
  of actions which can be triggered (e.g. open the inscription mask or append a
  new element).
- __Process viewer on engine__: The `Dev-Workflow-UI` and the `Axon Ivy Portal` now
  provide a process viewer.
