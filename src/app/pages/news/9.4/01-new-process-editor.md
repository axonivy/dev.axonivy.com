## New Process Editor {#processEditor}

Version 9.4 replaces the old AWT-based **Process Editor** with a new, fully web-based alternative. 
The new editor allows you to implement business processes even faster.

- __Browser compatible__: The new process editor runs on native web
  technologies.
- __Element palette__: The element palette is now divided into different categories
  to facilitate your search for the desired element.
- __Quick Actions__: Besides the new look and feel of the editor view, there is a new
  way to interact with process elements. The **Quick Action Bar** gives you a range
  of actions which can be triggered (e.g. open an inscription mask or append a
  new element).
- __Process viewer on engine__: The `Dev-Workflow-UI` and the `Axon Ivy Portal` now
  provide a process viewer.
