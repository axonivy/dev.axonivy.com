## Setup Wizard

With the new theme and the introduction of the **Engine Cockpit**,
the **Engine Config UI** doesn't really fit in our product toolset any longer. Because of that, we decided to
reengineer this initial setup as a new **Setup Wizard**.

* **Write Yaml**: As our new configuration lives in `yaml` files, the new wizard saves your settings correctly.
* **Better integration**: The Setup Wizard is part of the **Engine Cockpit**, so all parts of the wizard are integrated in the cockpit as well.
* **Improved Interface**: The user interface matches the theme of the 8.0 release.
* **Better guidance**: We are now giving you better feedback to smoothly configure your engine.
