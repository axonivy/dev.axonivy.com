## Modern Platform

We updated the platform of the Designer in order to bring even more fun and productivity into your daily work. Stay ahead!

 * __DARK__: Modern themes of the Eclipse platform can be used. You may give the new dark theme a try during your next nightly coding session.
 * __HDPI__: High resolution displays are now supported. Feel free to use a brand new device to work with Axon.ivy. 
 * __SCRIPTING__: Scripting editors now support linking and quick navigation to referenced classes and methods. Use the `F3`-Button or `Ctrl + click` to jump instantly to a resource.
 * __MARKETPLACE__: The now included Eclipse Marketplace allows you to access the universe of Eclipse tools. This will make you even more efficient.
