## Java 11 LTS

Axon.ivy now runs with Java 11. Which is the most recent LTS runtime for Java.

 * __Featured__: Use the latest language features such as `var` and make use of modern libraries built upon Java 11.
 * __Secure__: Rely upon the latest maintenance releases to run your solution.
 * __Light__: The Java runtime environment is quick as fox since optional features are released as such and the remaining core was put on a strict diet.
