## Run in Container

Running the Axon.ivy Engine in an isolated container has become a lot easier.

This means that the barriers between Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift and all other container orchestration platforms have been broken down!

 * __FULLY ISOLATED__: Software running in a container is completely isolated from the outside world.
 * __REPRODUCIBLE SYSTEMS__: Your system setup becomes fully reproducible in one go since the whole system configuration is defined in a so-called image.
 * __PORTABLE__: Build once, run everywhere! Once a docker image is generated it can be run on every system that supports Docker.
 * __DOCUMENTED INFRASTRUCTURE__: The entire Axon.ivy Engine system setup is part of an image and thus fully documented.
